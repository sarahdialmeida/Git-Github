### Markdown
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- [Gists](https://gist.github.com/)
- Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
- Files with the .md or .markdown extension
